## ðŸ“‘ Stakeholder Handoff Summary

### Overview of Project and Purpose
This project provides a lightweight machine learning prediction service with two interfaces:
- **Flask API** for programmatic access  
- **Streamlit Dashboard** for interactive use  
The purpose is to enable stakeholders to quickly test and demonstrate a trained model in both technical and non-technical contexts.

---

### Key Findings and Recommendations
- The trained model (`model.pkl`) can successfully generate predictions based on two numeric input features.  
- Both Flask and Streamlit interfaces run locally with minimal setup.  
- Recommendation:  
  - Use **Streamlit** for demos and non-technical stakeholders.  
  - Use **Flask** when integrating into larger systems or pipelines.

---

### Assumptions and Limitations
- Assumes the model file is located at `model/model.pkl`.  
- Only two numeric features are supported in current version.  
- No advanced error handling or input validation is included.  
- The project is designed for local testing, not production deployment.

---

### Risks and Potential Issues
- Running Flask with the built-in server is insecure for production.  
- Model may not generalize well if used outside intended scope.  
- Invalid or missing input could cause runtime errors.  
- Stakeholders must ensure consistent Python environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

### Instructions for Using Deliverables  (in README)

### Suggested Next Steps

Add input validation and error handling to improve robustness.

Expand support for additional features and model types.

Write unit tests and integrate CI/CD for quality assurance.

Dockerize application for easier handoff and deployment.

Explore deploying to a cloud service (AWS, Azure, or Heroku).
